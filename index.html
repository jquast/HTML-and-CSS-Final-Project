                <p>2nd Lt. Norman A. E. Quast's days in the military were unremarkable in that he went through flight school just like thousands before him, was sent to England like thousands before him, and was shot down and captured by the enemy like thousands before him.</p>
                <p>What was remarkable about Norm's service in the military, beside the fact that he may have been the only World War II aviator to receive a Purple Heart for wounds that he received as a result of being trampled by a horse, was the amount of documentation that he kept of his military service. He has <a href="https://norman.quast.life/enlisttrain.html#anchor">enlistment</a> documents, <a href="https://norman.quast.life/enlisttrain.html#anchor">training records</a>, newspaper clippings, <a href="https://norman.quast.life/homelife.html#anchor">Western Union</a> telegrams informing his parents of his status, a <a href="https://norman.quast.life/stalagluft1.html#anchor">diary</a> of his capture, his <a href="https://norman.quast.life/stalagluft1.html#anchor">German identification records</a>, <a href="https://norman.quast.life/stalagluft1.html#Camp Rules & Regulations">camp rules and regulations</a> from Stalag Luft 1 and plenty more.</p>

                <h2>A Wartime Log</h2>
                <p>Perhaps the most important item is <a href="https://norman.quast.life/awlframe.html">A Wartime Log</a> from the YMCA which he received in a Red Cross package. Norman has sketches, lists of fellow Krieges (prisoners), and lists comparing all sorts of things. His time as the camp librarian wasn't wasted either, he has a list of 92 books that he read during his 10 month stay in captivity. But perhaps the most important part of the book is 43 pages of poems and songs specific to World War II. By sharing them with you I hope to keep these poems alive for future generations. If you know the authors or history of any of these poems or songs, please contact me so I can include your information in the web site.</p>
                <p><b>&quot;I have been living with a private since you are gone. Please do not cut off my allotments as he does not make as much as you.&quot; RAF Sergeant's wife</b>. For a laugh, there are 4 pages of Excerpts of Letters From Home, that if nothing else, should be read. It is amazing how parents and loved ones viewed the life of a POW.</p>

                <h2>Norm's Life</h2>
                <p>I have organized the site with information on Norm's life in Bay City, Michigan <a href="https://norman.quast.life/lifebefore.html">before the war</a>, his enlistment in January of 1943, his <a href="https://norman.quast.life/enlisttrain.html">training</a>, and his <a href="https://norman.quast.life/8thairforce.html">service</a> with the 8th Air Force 390th Bomb Group stationed in Framlingham, England during June and July, 1944. On July 29th, 1944, on his 6th mission as a copilot on a B-17 Fortress he was shot down. He was <a href="https://norman.quast.life/missioncapture.html">captured</a> and remained a <a href="https://norman.quast.life/stalagluft1.html">POW</a> in Stalag Luft 1; Barth, Germany until his <a href="https://norman.quast.life/liberation.html">liberation</a> by the Russians in May of 1945. Additional information has been included on his <a href="https://norman.quast.life/triphome.html">trip home</a>, his <a href="https://norman.quast.life/lifeafter.html">life after</a> World War II for a returning vet, and what life was like for <a href="https://norman.quast.life/homelife.html">those he left behind</a>.</p>
